## Borrower



#### Definition

It is the entity that receives money (an asset) from another party accepting
the obligation to return it according to the agreed conditions.
These conditions usually include the additional payment of some interest
in compensation for the time in which the other party stopped having the money (asset) available.

The principal rights of the Borrower consist of disposing of the money
within the limits of the agreement, on the dates and purposes committed.
The main obligation is to return the amount granted plus interest and
expenses within the stipulated period.



#### Rational

It is an entity that requires funds to afford a project. For example, the
entity could be a natural person who wants to acquire a
good or service but does not have enough money to face it.

This person could apply for a loan through RCN by publishing a request on
the network. When a third party decides to fund the loan request, the credit
agreement is formalized, the Borrower receives the money along with the
obligation to return it with interest on the agreed dates.



#### Representation

In RCN protocol the Borrower can be a natural or legal person, an application
 or even a smart contract. There are no restrictions on this.
This entity is represented within the network by a unique address that
functions as ID and it is possible to verify the credit history
of the entity knowing the address.
