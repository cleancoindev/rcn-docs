## Lender


#### Definition

It is the entity that gives a certain amount of money (assets) in exchange
for a return commitment of the capital borrowed usually along with interest.

The lender understands perfectly that funding a credit implies assuming credit risk.
That is, the risk that the counterparty doesn't want or can't pay back its capital.



#### Rational

It is an entity that owns funds that don't need to use in a certain period of time
and seeks to make a profit investing it.

This entity, which may be an institutional investor or a natural person with surplus funds,
will seek to fund first those applications that promise to pay more interest.  
At the same time, it will try to lend to requests with less probability of default.

In a market where players act rationally, there will always be a trade-off between
these two drivers. For a given term, the most risky applications must pay higher rates.



#### Representation

In RCN protocol the Lender can be a natural or legal person, an application
 or even a smart contract. There are no restrictions on this.
This entity is represented within the network by a unique address that
functions as ID. An address is constituted as a Lender at the time it signs and funds a loan application.
The Lender can easily see where is the money invested and to what conditions.
