## Cosigner



#### Definition

It is an entity that co-signs along with the Borrower the promise to return
the money received in exchange for a fee.

In the event that the Borrower cannot fulfill its debt, the Cosigner will
respond to the Lender until the agreed party and, additionally, will make
the necessary efforts so that the Borrower pays its debt.



#### Rational

The Cosigner is included in the protocol to solve problems of lending between peers.
On one hand, P2P lending usually assumes the existence of a diversified Lender but this is almost never true.
Besides, most of the Lenders have neither the experience nor the right tools to perform debt collection strategies.


The Cosigner has the possibility and the know-how to bring together credits of similar risks
in order to estimate more accurately the probability of default. Whenever a borrower defaults,
the cosigner can use the fees collected from all the lenders to compensate the ones whose loans have defaulted.
Furthermore, the cosigner carries out different collection strategies to pursue
the defaulting debtors in the same legal jurisdiction.

There are no restrictions on who can act as Cosigner. To give some examples, it could be a wallet,
a financial institution, a collection agency, an insurance company, etc. Given the characteristics
of a loan, this entity will expect a higher fee the greater the debt to be cosigned. Both extremes
are possible, to cosign the total debt or even credits in
which the Lender prefers to retain all the risk and profit without including a Cosigner.

The inclusion of a cosigner substantially reduces the network loss and,
 as a result, improves credit conditions for both lenders and borrowers.



#### Representation

RCN protocol has no restrictions on who can act as Cosigner. It could be
a natural or legal person, an application or even a smart contract.

This entity is represented within the network by a unique address that
functions as ID. Considering that one of the main assets of Cosigner is its reputation,
the protocol includes an official list of Cosigner approved by the KYP policy.
